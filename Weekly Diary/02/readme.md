# WEEK 02

## MODULAR TYPOGRAPHY 

This week, we began by hunting and gathering examples of modular typography and sharing our findings with one another [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.g8ed135ac50_24_0). Since the studio was called code+words, we must not forget about the typography aspect of our creations, thus it was important to get to know the how words are made out of these basic units of type that build these letterforms just as how we start to get acquainted with code that makes up these digital realms we immerse ourselves in. 

My chosen typographer was Ahn Sang Soo (he was one of the more popular ones within the class too): 
- His first typeface designed in 1985

- In 2012, he founded the Paju Typography Institute (PaTI), an alternative design school, as well as AG Typography Institute, an organization that’s dedicated to not only the design of new typefaces, but research, writing, exhibitions, and book design.

- Reinvented linguistic illustration

- Breaks hangul characters into five basic elements: vertical, horizontal, and diagonal strokes, the dot, and the circle.

- exploiting the graphic flexibility of Hangul and removing it from its  square-framed constraints 

- “Ahn played with how letterforms interact, whether by elongating  breaking them and treating individual letters as purely graphic elements.

Why I consider this modular: 

- Meticulous (calculations) mathematical 
- Graphical and illustrative sometimes texture based like in his home gate
- Distinct system with tweaks

#### LETTERFORM SKETCH
Here are my letterform sketches. 

We were also asked to tinker with someone else's code. I tinkered with Amy's while Jackie tinkered with mine. Here are the outcomes! 


#### SIMS x HOUSE OF LEAVES 

Last week Kristine, Na and I formed our group and this week we have 2 new members, Un Ian and Millie. Together, we have decided to take on the 7th passage of The Navidson Record for Assignment 2. What we will do this week is to have a read and get together on Teams before lesson 3, to share our thoughts and what's striking about the text to us.
