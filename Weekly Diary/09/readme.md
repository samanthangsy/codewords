# WEEK 09 

## "TINKERING" 

I'm still feeling a bit directionless at this point and I'm getting stressed but I'm just going to keep going at it and experiment with code. I do feel like my skills are lacking so I really have to practice more. 

Here is my work in progress for 2 out of 5 quotes. 

I'm using the textToPoint function Karen introduced us to this week in this sketch 
We delivered the work-in-progress code for our project this week and then Karen demonstrated some sketches using textToPoint() and text appearing over time.

Here is my pop up ads attempt ( work in progress ).

I have no ideal how to make it brouncing around while avoiding the mouse. But after done some youtube tutorials,I suddenly realised that instead of make the window avoiding the mouse I can use the radome function to generate a new window when my mouse is approaching to the close button. haha problem solved.


5 sketches
All using clicks to reveal text 

IF THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLEâ€¦
Type 1-5 to toggle between sketches

This is what I understand...
having one main sketch.js file and other quote1/2/3/4/5.js files 
tinker with sketch.js index.html to link to the quote.js files as sources 

ALTERNATIVE
maybe create multiple canvases in one .js file
