# WEEK 09 

## "TINKERING" 

5 sketches
All using clicks to reveal text 

IF THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE…
Type 1-5 to toggle between sketches

referencing [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37979817/what-is-the-best-way-to-change-p5-js-canvas-dynamically-in-the-same-webpage)

This is what I understand...
having one main sketch.js file and other quote1/2/3/4/5.js files 
tinker with sketch.js index.html to link to the quote.js files as sources 

ALTERNATIVE
maybe create multiple canvases in one .js file 

## Sketch 1: Walter Benjamin

Quote: 
Our taverns and our metropolitan streets, our offices and furnished rooms, our railroad stations and our factories appeared to have us locked up hopelessly. Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder by the dynamite of the tenth of the second, so that now, in the midst of its far-flung ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go travelling. 
-Walter Benjamin 

What does this sketch do? 
Based on mouse x and y clicks, text increases and decreases in size while changing its colour. 

If no clicks are made, the text continuously jitters within a limited variation of size changes. 

There is also a particular point that allows the user to freeze the text to be able to read the entire quote clearly. 

Most of the clicks tends to shift the focus on the text “BURST THIS PRISON-WORLD…” and along with the jitters, it appears as though the text is trying to ‘burst’ out of the constraints of the window.
