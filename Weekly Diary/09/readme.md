# WEEK 09 

## "TINKERING" 

I'm still feeling a bit directionless at this point and I'm getting stressed but I'm just going to keep going at it and experiment with code. I do feel like my skills are lacking so I really have to practice more. 

Here is my work in progress for 2 out of 5 quotes. 

I'm using the textToPoint function Karen introduced us to this week in this sketch 

5 sketches
All using clicks to reveal text 

IF THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE…
Type 1-5 to toggle between sketches

referencing [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37979817/what-is-the-best-way-to-change-p5-js-canvas-dynamically-in-the-same-webpage)

This is what I understand...
having one main sketch.js file and other quote1/2/3/4/5.js files 
tinker with sketch.js index.html to link to the quote.js files as sources 

ALTERNATIVE
maybe create multiple canvases in one .js file
