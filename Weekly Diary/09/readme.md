# WEEK 09 

## "TINKERING" 

I'm still feeling a bit directionless at this point and I'm getting stressed but I'm just going to keep going at it and experiment with code. I do feel like my skills are lacking so I really have to practice more. 

Here is my work in progress for 2 out of 5 quotes. I'm using the textToPoint function Karen introduced us to this week in one of the sketches while the run function in the other. 

### WHAT I WANT TO DO 
IMAGE REPRESENTING TEXT: Create a legend of some sort where every character represents a certain graphic (may be with specific x,y coordinates or not depending on how different the outcomes are).

TOGGLE VIEW: With either a press of spacebar or a click of a button, the viewer can toggle between text and graphic view of the quotes.

TYPE FUNCTION: Direct user interaction through being able editing the quotes (removing or adding letters, jumbling up the text etc) 

UPDATE: I am exploring other options that put the focus on type rather than the graphics. The first option involves cleaning/messing up jumbled up text while the second option has type that goes from legible to distorted and vice versa. Both options conceal and reveal the key quotes. 

IF THIS IS POSSIBLEâ€¦
Type 1-5 to toggle between sketches

This is what I understand...
having one main sketch.js file and other quote1/2/3/4/5.js files 
tinker with sketch.js index.html to link to the quote.js files as sources 

ALTERNATIVE
maybe create multiple canvases in one .js file
