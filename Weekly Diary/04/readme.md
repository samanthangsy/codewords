# WEEK 4
## "PRIMER"

### PART 1: CODING
In this session, we learnt about 'function preload'. Where you import web based assets (images/fonts/external resources or libraries etc) in the sketch and declare these under this function. Karen led us through tutorials to set [type sizes](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/04/typetest), create [spinning texts](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/04/Accidental_String_Nuggie_Art) and include [fade](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/04/Spinning_Text_with_fade/).

note: cmd+k is the shortcut to go to the data folder

### PART 2: GITHUB

UPDATE: Github is actually awesome and I get why people use it. 

I'm not going to lie, Github scares me. I have always been taking down notes on my notes app on my laptop and taking a bunch of screenshots to look back on. That's what i'm the most comfortable with. Today we learnt the basics of github and here are some of my notes below. 

- GitHub pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.
- MAKE WEEKLY FOLDERS ON GITHUB 
- SKO CAN LOOK LIKE ANYTHING
- Could be a directed reading page by page or everything laid out 
- SKO is about CONTEXT 
- Editing, contextualising, communicating 
- Could be a hybrid of js,css,html
