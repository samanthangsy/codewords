# WEEK 11

## "HURDLE"

## Andy's comment
"great gym of different sketches. you clearly are building lots of "coding" muscles. Choose one to play with... at most develop into multiple paragraphs."

note to self: be reductive! 

### OPTIONS TO CONSIDER
- Stick to 4 separate layouts hidden and shown through keyTyped
- Combine 2-3 sketches into one scrollable page where animations are more dynamic and cohesive 

### USE OF MUSIC
Kim Cascone, in his post-digital recognition manifesto, located glitch music in a wider spectrum of sound based on the “aesthetics of failure”.

### TRACK OPTIONS
- gps jammer output 
- 4+2_stil live-Remix by Taylor Deupree 
- Black Gun Red 

### TO DO  
- create instructional landing page
- introduce scrolling into the code 
- input song 
- piece together 3 paragraphs into the scrollable page
