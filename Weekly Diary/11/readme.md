# WEEK 11

## "HURDLE"

## ANDY'S SUGGESTION 
Today is the final class before submission next week. CRUNCH TIME!!! 

After speaking to Karen and getting some help with combining the sketches in my code (thanks Karen for this), I had a conversation with Andy about my concept and he said that it was good to see the explorations of code but I could consider focusing on 1 or 2 to build up on. That might create a stronger outcome for me. 

"great gym of different sketches. you clearly are building lots of "coding" muscles. Choose one to play with... at most develop into multiple paragraphs."

I need to reconsider why I'm trying to show SO MUCH. 

note to self: be reductive! 

### OPTIONS TO CONSIDER
- Stick to 4 separate layouts hidden and shown through keyTyped
- Combine 2-3 sketches into one scrollable page where animations are more dynamic and cohesive 

### USE OF MUSIC
Kim Cascone, in his post-digital recognition manifesto, located glitch music in a wider spectrum of sound based on the “aesthetics of failure”.

### TRACK OPTIONS
- gps jammer output 
- 4+2_stil live-Remix by Taylor Deupree 
- Black Gun Red 

### TO DO  
- create instructional landing page
- introduce scrolling into the code 
- input song 
- piece together 3 paragraphs into the scrollable page
