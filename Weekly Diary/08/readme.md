# WEEK 08

## "EXPLORATION"

##### CURRENT CONCEPT FOR WORK
-Basing my work off the context of how images consist of a string of text when you open it on textedit or notepad.

-Create a legend of some sort where every character represents a certain graphic (may be with specific x,y coordinates or not depending on how different the outcomes are).

-With either a press of spacebar or a click of a button, the viewer can toggle between text and graphic view of the quotes.

-Possibility for quotes to be jumbled on its own. Maybe even like a random walker so it just travels across the page

-Direct user interaction through being able editing the quotes (removing or adding letters, jumbling up the text etc)

-The new text layout will in turn produce a new visual layout. 

-Overlaid new visual on the original layout to show the glitch
