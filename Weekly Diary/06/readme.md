# WEEK 6 
## "IDEATION"

### PAPER PROTOTYPING AND PSEUDOCODE 
Today, we were introduced to paper prototyping and psuedocode by using a retro game as reference. We were then tasked to create pseudocode for an everyday activity. here is my pseudo code below. 

```
How to decide if I should stay in bed

Once I wake up
START
PRINT “do you wake up or nah”

INPUT time
CASE time of 

<0700: PRINT “nope” 
<1200: PRINT “lie in bed a little longer” 
>1200: PRINT “is mum is at home?”

IF time > 1200
CHECK if mum is at home

IF mum is at home THEN get out of bed
PRINT “LOOK ALIVE”
ELSE stay in bed longer
ENDIF mum has already shouted at me to get out of bed

```

These exercises help us with the next steps towards our major project. 

### CODING GYM 

On this week's episode of coding gym with Karen, we explored [controlling leading](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/06/fixed_it_was_a_dream). Ended up with a [glitch](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/06/tried_responsive_leading_ended_up_with_glitch)here. We also learnt how to input [random letters popping up](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/06/fixed_random_characters_with_fade) on the screen with a fade. This is with a [circle wiper](https://samanthangsy.github.io/codewords/Weekly%20Diary/06/random_characters_no_fade_with_circle_wiper)and no fade.


### START OF MAJOR PROJECT 4 REAL 

<img src="glitchmomentum.png">

Our homework for the break is to create paper prototypes for the major project. I have chosen The Glitch Moment(um) by Rosa Menkman. My initial idea was to focus on the concluding paragraph of the text, but after re-reading the text again, I realised that Menkman had included these wonderful quotes by philisophers and theorists in the publication that I felt emphasised the meanings I had gathered from the book. 

The chosen quotes are the following: 
- I don’t use the accident. I deny the accident. There is no accident, just as there is no beginning and no end. -Jackson Pollock 

- You cannot prohibit the catastrophe, you must surf it! -Paul Virilio 

- The only resolution to the problem of non-communication was to incorporate it within the system. -Friedrich Kittler

- Our taverns and our metropolitan streets, our offices and furnished rooms, our railroad stations and our factories appeared to have us locked up hopelessly. Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder by the dynamite of the tenth of the second, so that now, in the midst of its far-flung ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go traveling. -Walter Benjamin 

- Malfunction and failure are not signs of improper production. On the contrary, they indicate the active production of the “accidental potential” in any product. The invention of the ship implies its wreckages, the steam engine and the locomotive discover the derailment. -Paul Virilio
