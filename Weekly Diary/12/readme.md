# Reductive Coding 

Options to consider: 
- ~Stick to 4 separate layouts hidden and shown through keyTyped~
- Combine 2-3 sketches into one scrollable page where animations are more dynamic and cohesive 

## Use of music to enhance glitch effect
Kim Cascone, in his post-digital recognition manifesto, located glitch music in a wider spectrum of sound based on the “aesthetics of failure”.

## Track options 
- gps jammer output 
- 4+2_stil live-Remix by Taylor Deupree 
- Black Gun Red 

## To do: 
- create instructional landing page
- introduce scrolling into the code 
- input song 
- piece together 3 paragraphs into the scrollable page

‘Embrace the Error’ takes the reader on a digital adventure through the words of philosophers, Walter Benjamin and Paul Virilio as quoted by Rosa Menkman in The Glitch Moment(um).

This book piqued my interest in spontaneity in the accident form and got me thinking of some questions. Are glitches just technological phenomena or are they social constructions reactive to technological expectations? Why is there always a negative connotation to ‘failing’, when we can in turn choose to embrace the ‘accidental potential’ of it. I feel this applies to everything in life and thus is why gliyeeeeetch theory speaks to me. 

Through this adventure, the reader is hopefully able to perceive glitches differently, where in the case of affecting text readability, though compromised can still be read thus still serving its sole purpose. The intention of ‘Embrace the Error’ lies within the process of coding it as well, which involved making plenty of mistakes crucial to producing the end product. 

Towards the end, the user has two options: to keep surfing the catastrophe, embracing it or to click once or a couple times, in search to fix or change the outcome. This leads to the screen freezing first before the text disappears, leaving a wash of flashing colours over the entire screen as the reader tries to navigate through it again. The system has however, broken and that marks the end of the adventure.

Kim Cascone is known for his paper The Aesthetics of Failure, which outlines the use of digital glitches and systemic failure in the creation of post-digital and laptop music.
