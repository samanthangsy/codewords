## Reductive Coding 

#### Hello! This is Sam's SKO, where learning, process, thoughts and resources collected over the course of 12 weeks for Codewords have been documented.

###### Options to consider: 
- Stick to 4 separate layouts hidden and shown through keyTyped
- Combine 2-3 sketches into one scrollable page where animations are more dynamic and cohesive 

###### Use of music to enhance glitch effect
Kim Cascone, in his post-digital recognition manifesto, located glitch music in a wider spectrum of sound based on the “aesthetics of failure”.

###### Track options 
- gps jammer output 
- 4+2_stil live-Remix by Taylor Deupree 
- Black Gun Red 

###### To do: 
- create instructional landing page
- introduce scrolling into the code 
- input song 
- piece together 3 paragraphs into the scrollable page
