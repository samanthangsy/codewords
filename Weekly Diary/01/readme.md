# WEEK 01
### Code...Words?
<img src="intro.png">
We began the first session of code+words with some introductions by Andy and Karen. We were given an overview of what to expect and the format of our class in the coming weeks.

Andy invited us to interact and explore (virtual) Melbourne in Minecraft. Personally, I was amazed at the level of detail. I had heard of Minecraft and watched a couple short videos on it but I had never played it before so this was an experience for me.

We also talked about reading in the digital age and touched on the prevalence of virtual gatherings/social events given the fact that we are currently experiencing this a global pandemic. One example that was mentioned was Travis Scott's Astronomical event on Fortnite. This actually got me thinking of human adaptation and the shift from real life to virtual worlds through technological means. Yes, we may be spaced apart from one another but that does not mean that all interaction is gone. Obviously the level/type of interaction is different, but when we are in virtual worlds maybe where our looks/race/disabilities are hidden, some could find the quality of these interactions working better for them. 


##### INTRO TO P5.JS 

In our first live coding session, we were introduced to the basics of Processing using p5.js. Karen taughts us how to set canvas sizes, apply colours, lines, shapes and some simple interactivity using mouse positions. To apply our newfound knowledge, we were individually tasked to create a sketches for our intials. 

Here are my sketches.
