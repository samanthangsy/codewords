#### SKO STATEMENT: ONGOING LEARNING 

I chose to take Codewords with no expectations but to learn and sure enough, I did. I want to try to keep this short because I do have the tendency to ramble on and on so here is a summarised list of things I have learnt through this course.

Codewords surpassed my expectations because of how much I feel I have learnt from these long and intense sessions (but enjoyable, no doubt). Not only did we pick up new technical skills and better theoretical understanding of how reading is changing in this digital age we live in, this studio leaves me speculating the endless possibilities on technology's impact on design and our lives during the pandemic and post-pandemic. 

15 October 2020: A bittersweet day. The last day of class for the week/in RMIT/forever for now. Concluding my degree remotely from my home country in Singapore feels weird, almost surreal and anti-climatic even. 

Nonetheless, It was a pleasure to conclude my last semester in uni with Andy and Karen and I would like to thank them both for being the most patient and understanding tutors I have met at RMIT, always willing to share their abundant knowledge with us :') 

Digital hugs, 

Sam
