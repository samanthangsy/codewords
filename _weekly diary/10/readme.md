5 sketches
All using clicks to reveal text 

IF THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE…
Type 1-5 to toggle between sketches

This is what I understand...
having one main sketch.js file and other quote1/2/3/4/5.js files 
tinker with sketch.js index.html to link to the quote.js files as sources 

ALTERNATIVE
maybe create multiple canvases in one .js file and use keyPressed (spacebar
